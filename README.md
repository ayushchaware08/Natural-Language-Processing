## 👨‍💻 Project 1: Twitter Sentiment Analysis Model
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a complete workflow for performing sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

**📌 Key Components**

- Dataset Loading: Importing a Twitter dataset containing labeled tweets.
- Data Preprocessing: Lowercasing, removing mentions, hashtags, URLs, special characters, and stopwords. Along with Tokenization and lemmatization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations including word clouds and sentiment distribution.
- Feature Engineering: Converting text to numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Model Building: Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM.
- Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate performance.
- Prediction: Making predictions on new tweet samples.

**📦 Libraries Used**

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, re, wordcloud, sklearn

**📈 Goal**

To classify the sentiment of a tweet as positive, negative, or neutral using machine learning techniques.

## 👨‍💻 Project 2: Text Summarizer Model

This project is part of the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) Solution Challenge, aimed at solving real-world problems using technology. The focus of this notebook is on text classification using NLP to address a socially relevant issue.

**📌 Key Components**

- Problem Statement: Aims to classify user-generated text into relevant categories (context suggests a focus on mental health, support needs, or community queries).
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning of text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering). Along Tokenization and lemmatization.
- Text Vectorization: Using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer for converting text into numerical format.
- Model Building: Classification models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM trained to categorize text.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for model evaluation.

**👤 Use Case:**

Can be adapted to applications like mental health support bots, categorization of user questions, or social impact NLP tasks.

**📦 Libraries Used**

pandas, numpy, nltk, re, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

**🎯 Goal**

To build an NLP pipeline capable of classifying user-generated content to support scalable and automated solutions for social impact.
